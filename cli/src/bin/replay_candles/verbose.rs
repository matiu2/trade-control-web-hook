//! Per-bar state-delta trace for `--verbose` (a.k.a. `--all-events`).
//!
//! The engine's [`evaluate_plan`](trade_control_engine::evaluate_plan) advances
//! the [`PlanState`](trade_control_engine::PlanState) silently: most of what it
//! decides per bar — a phase transition, the `break-and-close` stamp, the
//! **retest lookback stamp** — leaves no fired intent and so never appears in the
//! normal report. The classic confusion is "the plan requires a `retest` prep but
//! I never saw one fire": retest isn't an emitted prep at all, it's a retroactive
//! `retest_seen_at` stamp the entry gate later reads (see the engine module doc).
//!
//! This module makes those invisible state changes visible. The replay loop
//! snapshots the state **before and after** each live tick and records a
//! [`BarTrace`] of what changed — the new phase, any newly-set timestamps, and
//! the rule ids that fired this bar. `--verbose` then interleaves these traces
//! with the fire report, so the operator can see *exactly* which bar stamped the
//! retest, when the spine advanced, and which bars passed silently.
//!
//! It is a pure diff of two [`PlanState`] snapshots — no engine change, no extra
//! evaluation. A bar where nothing changed and nothing fired yields a trace whose
//! [`BarTrace::is_quiet`] is true; the renderer can skip those to keep the output
//! legible, or show them under a future `--all-bars`.
