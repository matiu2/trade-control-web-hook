//! Storage abstraction for replay protection (`seen:<id>`) and instrument
//! cooldowns (`cooldown:<instrument>`).
//!
//! A trait keeps the dispatch logic transport-agnostic so a non-CF deployment
//! (e.g. self-hosted on a home machine) can swap in a file-backed store later
//! without touching the core. The Cloudflare KV implementation lives next to
//! the trait for now; when a second backend lands it'll move behind a feature.
