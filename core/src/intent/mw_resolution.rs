//! M / W (double-top / double-bottom) entry resolution.
//!
//! The standard [`Resolved::from_intent`] path reads `entry` /
//! `stop_loss` / `take_profit` straight off the intent. M/W setups
//! carry none of those — instead `tv-arm` bakes the path geometry into
//! [`MwParams`] (neckline, first point, runup start, arm-time spread +
//! pip size, all **MID** prices) and the worker derives the stop-entry
//! order, stop loss and take-profit here, per bar close, from those
//! baked params.
//!
//! ## Mid → bid/ask correction
//!
//! The book's M/W rules are written for **bid** charts; ours are
//! **mid**. We apply the *mid-correct* translation: `±½ spread` on every
//! level to reach the bid (sell) / ask (buy) the book assumed, on top of
//! the book's own pip buffers.
//!
//! With `half_spread = spread/2`, `half_pip = ½·pip`, `one_pip = pip`:
//!
//! ```text
//! W (long, fill @ ask):
//!   entry = neckline + half_spread + half_pip
//!   sl    = first_point + half_spread − (spread + one_pip)   // below the trough
//!   tp    = entry + (entry − sl)                             // exactly 1R
//!
//! M (short, fill @ bid):
//!   entry = neckline − half_spread − half_pip
//!   sl    = first_point − half_spread + (spread + one_pip)   // above the peak
//!   tp    = entry − (sl − entry)                             // exactly 1R
//! ```
//!
//! TP is exactly 1R off the *entry*, so the spread already embedded in
//! entry and SL carries straight through — no extra TP shift needed.
//!
//! ## Why a real-time arming gate at all
//!
//! The strategy book is a **post-hoc** method: the analyst looks at a
//! chart where *both* towers of the M are already printed and simply puts
//! a stop at the neckline ("entry on the break of the neckline … no
//! retest required"). We arm in **real time**, when only the **left
//! shoulder (B)** and the **neckline (C)** are complete — the right tower
//! hasn't formed yet. So we cannot just "enter on neckline break": at the
//! moment of a break we don't yet know whether a genuine right tower
//! formed. The two gates below are the live stand-ins for the validity
//! the book gets for free from a finished chart.
//!
//! ## Right-tower confirmation window
//!
//! Before arming the breakout stop, the bar must show a real second
//! peak/trough — price that has rallied (M) / dropped (W) back *into* the
//! pattern far enough to count as a right tower, the live equivalent of
//! the book's "the right side's top is close to the left side's top"
//! check. The bar's extreme (high for an M, low for a W) must reach
//! **within 30% of the left-shoulder high** — i.e. into the top 30% of the
//! neckline→first-point (C→B) leg — and stay below the 1.3 extension:
//!
//! ```text
//!   right_tower = neckline + 0.7 × (first_point − neckline)   // within 30% of B
//!   cancel      = neckline + 1.3 × (first_point − neckline)
//!   confirmed  ⇔  high (M) / low (W) ∈ [right_tower, cancel)
//! ```
//!
//! Below `right_tower` the second peak is too shallow; at/above `cancel`
//! the 1.3 extension is breached and the pattern is invalidated (the same
//! level the `mw-cancel` veto guards — checked here too as a safety net).
//! Either way the bar is declined and the setup stays armed. This fixes a
//! real AUD/CAD case where a bar closing just past the neckline but with a
//! high short of the second peak armed (and filled) a premature short.
//!
//! ## "Middle of the M" downward-cross trigger
//!
//! A confirmed right tower says the shape is valid; it does not say price
//! is *rolling back off* it yet. The arming trigger is the bar that
//! crosses back down (M) / up (W) through the **50% level of the C→B
//! leg** — the "middle of the M":
//!
//! ```text
//!   mid50 = neckline + 0.5 × (first_point − neckline)
//!   M (short): high ≥ mid50  AND  close < mid50   // crossed down through the middle
//!   W (long):  low  ≤ mid50  AND  close > mid50   // crossed up through the middle
//! ```
//!
//! Only once price has both confirmed a right tower *and* crossed back
//! through the middle do we arm the breakout stop. A bar that fails the
//! cross is declined and the setup stays armed for the next bar.
//!
//! ## "Stay armed" semantics
//!
//! The enter alert fires every bar close. A bar that fails the
//! confirmation window above, or whose close has *not* yet broken the
//! neckline (so the breakout stop would sit on the wrong side of the
//! current price), is declined here with
//! [`ResolveError::NotArmedYet`] — a benign "decline this bar" outcome
//! distinct from the genuine bad-request [`ResolveError::InvalidGeometry`]
//! (operator typo: SL on the wrong side). The worker maps `NotArmedYet`
//! to a 2xx decline, not a 400. Post the 2026-06 seen-id fix a non-`Ok`
//! resolve does **not** mark the intent id seen, so the next bar's fire
//! is allowed through — i.e. the setup stays armed until a bar actually
//! breaks out (or a cancel / abort / expiry veto ends it).
