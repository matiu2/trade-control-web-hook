//! The native [`CronEnv`] — the VM runtime's side of the shared cron seam.
//!
//! The shared engine tick ([`trade_control_cron::run_engine_tick`]) is generic
//! over the [`CronEnv`](trade_control_cron::CronEnv) trait: three
//! backend-specific operations (broker acquisition, dispatch-config resolution,
//! tick recording) the engine can't do itself. The wasm worker fills them from
//! Cloudflare `&Env`; [`NativeCronEnv`] fills them from the Postgres account
//! index ([`PgMetadataStore`]) + process [`Secrets`], reusing the same
//! `acquire_oanda` / `acquire_tn` / `build_dispatch_config_native` helpers the
//! HTTP receiver uses.
//!
//! It holds an `Arc<AppState>` so it shares the receiver's pool/secrets exactly
//! (one connection pool, one secrets snapshot). The cron runs on the same
//! local-thread runtime the HTTP dispatcher uses (see [`crate::scheduler`]), so
//! the `?Send` broker futures are legal here.
