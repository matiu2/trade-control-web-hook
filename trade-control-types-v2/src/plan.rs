//! The v2 **fact-based, per-line-generic** plan model.
//!
//! This is a clean-slate rewrite of the plan shape (see
//! `SCOPING-rule-based-engine.md`). Unlike v1's [`trade_control_core::trade_plan::TradePlan`]
//! — which carries a `Phase`-driven sequential spine of [`ConditionRule`]s each
//! with its own inline `Trigger` geometry — a v2 [`TradePlan`] separates
//! **lines** (named geometry) from **rules** (behaviour that *references* a line
//! by name). Facts are keyed by that line name, so break-and-close, retest, and
//! enter meet on `(line, kind)` without a central state machine.
//!
//! # The `Rule` name split
//!
//! There are two "rule" concepts and they must not collide:
//!
//! - [`PlanRule`] (here) — **plan data**: serializable, part of the wire format
//!   `tv-arm-v2` will bake. It *describes* a rule (which line, which kind, what
//!   to fire).
//! - [`Rule`](crate::rule::Rule) — **behaviour**: the trait the driver ticks.
//!
//! We keep the trait named `Rule` (it's the verb-y, behavioural thing the whole
//! engine is *about*) and call the data struct `PlanRule` (it's "a rule *in the
//! plan*"). A `PlanRule` is turned into a boxed `dyn Rule` by the driver.
