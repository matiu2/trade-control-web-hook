//! [`FactKind`] — a fact's *kind* as a compile-time type, not a string.
//!
//! A fact is keyed by `(line, kind)` (shared) or `(rule_id, kind)` (scratch). The
//! **kind** half is always known to the rule at compile time — the retest rule
//! *always* writes `Retest`, break-and-close *always* writes `BreakClose` — so it
//! is a natural fit for a type rather than a stringly-typed literal sprinkled
//! across the codebase. Modelling it as a type makes name collisions a **compile
//! error** and lets a setup crate (H&S, M/W, future trend-following) define its
//! own kinds without a central enum everyone must edit.
//!
//! # Zero-size markers + a trait (open set, per-crate)
//!
//! Each kind is a zero-size marker struct implementing [`FactKind`], whose only
//! payload is a stable [`FactKind::NAME`]. That name is what actually lands in the
//! serialized `Facts` blackboard (the engine's, in `trade-control-engine-v2`) —
//! the on-the-wire format is unchanged, still strings — so the type layer is a
//! **compile-time convenience over a string-keyed store**, not a new wire format.
//! Rules refer to kinds by type (`facts.set::<BreakClose, Neckline>(…)`); the
//! store holds `NAME`.
//!
//! An open trait (rather than one closed `enum FactKind`) is deliberate: kinds
//! live in whatever crate owns the rule that writes them. The four below are the
//! ones the current slice needs; a new setup adds its own marker structs in its
//! own crate.
//!
//! The **line** half of the key is the sibling [`LineName`](crate::LineName)
//! trait (also here); `rule_id` (scratch) is inherently runtime and stays a
//! string.
